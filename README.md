MarsColony Game
A Python-based grid strategy game where you build and manage a colony on Mars. This project was developed as part of an Advanced Programming course for a Bachelor's degree.
Game Overview
MarsColony is a survival strategy game where players must build and manage a sustainable colony on Mars. The goal is to grow your population to 200 inhabitants while managing resources and surviving environmental hazards like meteorite impacts.
Objective

Win Condition: Reach 200 inhabitants
Lose Condition: Food count drops below zero
Survive meteorite impacts and manage your resources wisely

Buildings
Resource Generating Buildings

Bio Dome: Generates 12 food per day (requires power and manpower)
Ore Mine: Generates 10 metal per day (requires power and manpower)

Infrastructure Buildings

Solar Park: Provides power to buildings within a 5-cell radius
Living Compartment: Houses 10 inhabitants and provides manpower within a 3-cell radius

All buildings cost 2 metal to construct.
Environmental Features

Mars Rocks: Natural obstacles blocking construction
Volcanoes: Impassable terrain features
Meteorites: Random events that can destroy buildings or create craters
Day/Night Cycle: Resources are generated every 20 seconds (1 game day)

Controls

Left Click: Select buildings from sidebar or place them on the grid
Grid Click:

With building selected: Place building (if resources available)
Without building selected: View cell information


Building Selection: Click on building names in sidebar to select/deselect

How to Run

Ensure Python 3.x and pygame are installed
Clone or download the project
Navigate to the project directory
Run the game:

bashpython main.py
Game Mechanics
Resource Management

Metal: Used for construction, generated by Ore Mines
Food: Consumed daily by inhabitants, generated by Bio Domes
Population: Provided by Living Compartments

Power System

Buildings need power (from Solar Parks) and manpower (from Living Compartments) to function
Buildings within the radius of power/manpower sources will operate efficiently

Environmental Hazards

Meteorites spawn randomly with increasing frequency over time
Meteorites can destroy buildings or create temporary craters
Living Compartments and Solar Parks are immune to meteorite damage

Starting Conditions

Game begins with 3 buildings: 1 Ore Mine, 1 Living Compartment, 1 Solar Park
These are automatically placed in a cluster to ensure initial functionality

Educational Context
This game was developed as a project for an Advanced Programming course at university level. It demonstrates:

Object-Oriented Programming: Inheritance hierarchies, abstract classes
Game Development: Event-driven programming, real-time updates
UI Design: Grid-based interfaces, sidebar management
Resource Management: Game balance and progression systems
Threading: Asynchronous operations for visual effects

Key Programming Concepts Used

Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
Inheritance and Polymorphism
Event-driven architecture
Grid-based coordinate systems
Threading for time-based effects
Pygame for graphics and user input
